FallingBlockGame
================

The JavaScript code in this repository implements a simple clone of a falling-block game that was incredibly popular in the 1990s (whose name I won't mention, because the copyright trolls who currently own that name are infamously litigious).  To see it in action, clone the repository and open the file _FallingBlockGame.html in a web browser that runs JavaScript. 

Use the A and D keys to move the current block back and forth, the W key to rotate it, and the S key to cause it to fall faster.
